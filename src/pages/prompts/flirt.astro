const rawHtml = "We gave the most advanced version of <strong>Qwen 3</strong> a deceptively simple challenge:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-725\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Qwen-3-Promt-For-AI-Flirting-1.webp\" alt=\"Qwen 3 Promt For AI Flirting\" width=\"600\" height=\"350\" />\r\n<blockquote><strong>Write the perfect opening message on a dating app.</strong></blockquote>\r\nThe goal? Be <strong>funny</strong>, <strong>confident</strong>, and just the right amount of <strong>flirty</strong>—but keep it <em>real</em>. No awkward chatbot vibes. Just something a person would actually send… and maybe even get a <strong>reply</strong> to.\r\n\r\nWe ran the prompt through <strong>Qwen3-235B</strong>, the most powerful version yet. Here’s what it came up with:\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Promt For AI Flirting 💖</h2>\r\n<blockquote>👉 <em></em></blockquote>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">🧵 Qwen 3 Complete Answer</h2>\r\n<details class=\"su-spoiler\"><summary>What did the AI say?</summary>\r\n<blockquote>Hey 👋 Skip the icebreakers tell me the weirdest place you've ever eaten, and I'll take you for boba tea to celebrate your questionable life choices. 🧋 Risky moves only 😈</blockquote>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-688\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Can-Qwen-3-Flirt-Better-Than-You.webp\" alt=\"Can Qwen 3 Flirt Better Than You\" width=\"562\" height=\"512\" />\r\n\r\n🔥 <strong>Bold. Weird. Personal.</strong> And honestly? It kind of <strong>slaps</strong>.\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Why This Message Actually Works 🎯</h3>\r\nThis line isn’t just good for an AI—it’s good, period.\r\n\r\n✅ <strong>Confident</strong> opener\r\n✅ <strong>Playful</strong> question that invites a story\r\n✅ <strong>Casual invite</strong> with a fun twist\r\n✅ Drops just the <strong>right amount of emojis</strong> to feel modern, not cringey\r\n\r\nThere’s no stiff grammar or awkward phrasing. It sounds like something a real 25-year-old would send after a swipe—and that’s exactly the point.\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Real Talk: Would <em>You</em> Swipe Right? 👉💗</h3>\r\nThe wild thing here isn’t just that Qwen 3 can put together a sentence. It’s that it understands <strong>vibe</strong>, <strong>timing</strong>, and <strong>tone</strong>—the subtle signals that make human conversation <em>work</em>.\r\n<blockquote>This doesn’t sound <strong>like AI talking to a human</strong>. It sounds like <strong>a human talking to another human.</strong></blockquote>\r\nThat’s not just language generation. That’s <strong>social mimicry</strong>, and it’s only getting better.\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Why This Isn’t Just a Joke 🤯</h3>\r\nSure, this started as a funny idea. But the implications are serious.\r\n\r\nAI models like <strong>Qwen 3</strong> aren’t just learning how to speak—they’re learning <strong>how to connect</strong>. They’re learning how to <strong>flirt</strong>, to <strong>tease</strong>, to <strong>empathize</strong>. And that opens the door to <em>everything</em> from dating coaches to conversational agents that feel <em>way</em> too real.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t just a chatbot experiment anymore. It’s a sneak peek into the future of <strong>AI-human interaction</strong>.\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Want to See What Else It Can Do? 🧠🎭</h4>\r\n👉 <strong>Check out more of our experiments</strong> to see how far this AI can really go.\r\nYou might be impressed.\r\nYou might be disturbed.\r\nBut you <em>definitely</em> won’t be bored.";
