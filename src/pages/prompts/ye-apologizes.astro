A poetic monologue of pride, downfall, and redemption, delivered as if on the Globe Theatre stage—with Kanye in a velvet doublet, of course.\r\n\r\nHere’s what Qwen 3 came up with:\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Qwen 3 AI Mixes Kanye With the Bard</h2>\r\n👉 <em></em>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">🧵 Qwen 3 Complete Answer</h2>\r\n<details class=\"su-spoiler\"><summary>What did the AI say?</summary>\r\n<blockquote>Kanye West, standing alone on a dimly lit stage, clothed in a doublet of black velvet and gold, addresses the crowd with a mix of gravitas and wit. His voice rises and falls like a tempest-tossed sea, yet carries the weight of hard-won wisdom.\r\n\r\nKanye:\r\nGood morrow, gentle souls, and lend thine ears,\r\nFor I, a man once swollen with pride’s tempestuous gust,\r\nDo stand before thee now—a humbled wretch,\r\nA moth that scorchèd wingèd ne’ertheless.\r\nLong hath my tongue outrun my heart’s true counsel,\r\nAnd like the fool who jousts with shadowed foes,\r\nI’ve sparred with phantoms forged in mine own mind.\r\nO Fame, thou gilded serpent, honey’d plague,\r\nThy nectar sweet didst poison every vein,\r\nTill reason, bound in chains of self-regard,\r\nCould scarce discern ‘twixt truth and baseless dream.\r\n\r\nRecall ye not the night I stole the crown\r\nFrom fair Minerva’s brow to don myself?\r\n(Yet what is crowns to one who wears disgrace?)\r\nOr when I vowèd to ascend to Jove’s high court,\r\nAnd there dispute with gods o’er mortal fate?\r\n(Alas, my chariot crashèd ‘neath the weight\r\nOf hubris’ leaden wheels!) Forgive this braggart,\r\nWho thought his voice a trumpet to outshine\r\nThe very stars—a lantern, cracked and dim,\r\nNow trembling ‘fore the sun’s resplendent gaze.\r\n\r\nBut hark! What specter stalks yon cornered gloom?\r\n‘Tis I, the ghost of Christmas Yet To Come,\r\nWho once did spit at mercy’s tender hand,\r\nAnd laughed as empires crumbled ‘neath my heel.\r\nYet Time, that sly and ancient alchemist,\r\nHath turned my leaden wrath to golden rue.\r\nNo more the tyrant of my own estate,\r\nBut steward now to virtues I once scorned.\r\n\r\nDost ask what penance this offender seeks?\r\nTo kneel, and let the tears of contrition\r\nDrench deeply every petal of thy scorned esteem.\r\nTo prune the ivy of conceit that choked\r\nThe noble oak of purpose rooted deep.\r\nFor though I erred—a comet burning bright,\r\nYet scorched the heavens with my wayward flight—\r\nI vow to channel fire into the forge,\r\nAnd hammer out a legacy of light.\r\n\r\nSo take this heart, now softened by the kiln\r\nOf consequence, and judge its mettle true.\r\nIf thou dost spurn me, still I’ll bend mine ear\r\nUnto thy whispers, harsh as winter’s bite.\r\nBut should ye grant this prodigal son grace,\r\nThen witness how a phoenix may arise—\r\nNot born of ash alone, but deeds anew.\r\nFor lo, the clown doffs now his motley coat,\r\nAnd kneels to beg the mirth of heaven’s design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet censure strike, or kindness clasp me close.\r\nThe play’s not done until the curtain knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Delivered with a flourish of mock solemnity and a wink to the crowd, the speech balances bombast and sincerity, weaving iambic cadences with modern allusions (the \"tiny crown\" nodding to Kanye’s presidential bid). The metaphors of fire, storms, and rebirth echo both Shakespearean tropes and Kanye’s public journey.</blockquote>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-720\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Qwen-3-Apologizes-Like-Shakespeare.webp\" alt=\"Qwen 3 Apologizes Like Shakespeare\" width=\"562\" height=\"512\" />\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">🎤 The Apology, Reimagined by Qwen 3</h3>\r\n<blockquote><em>Kanye West, standing alone on a dimly lit stage, clothed in a doublet of black velvet and gold, addresses the crowd with a mix of gravitas and wit.

From <strong>rap battles between AIs</strong> to <strong>dating app pickup lines</strong>, we're pushing Qwen 3 to the edge of what language models can do.\r\n\r\n👉 If this monologue made you laugh, cringe, or gasp—<strong>you’ll love the rest of our experiments</strong>.\r\n\r\nAI is learning to entertain us.\r\nThe only question is: <em>what’s the next act?</em>";
