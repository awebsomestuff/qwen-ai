With Alibaba Cloud’s large-language-model family powering chatbots, code assistants, and enterprise analytics, that question now sits at the top of many security roadmaps. Below, you’ll find an independent, experience-driven look at how Qwen AI collects, stores, and trains on your data; where risks stem from China’s evolving data laws; and what concrete steps individuals and businesses can take to stay compliant and protected.</p><div class="ad-afterintro-container"><div class="ad-afterintro-inner"><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-9609544329602409" data-ad-slot="8310388095" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></div></div>\r\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Qwen-AI-Safety.webp\" alt=\"Qwen AI Safety\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1169\" />\r\n<h2>Qwen AI Data Collection Policy Explained (2025 Update)</h2>\r\n<h3>Rapid Model Evolution &amp; Qwen 2.5 Training Data Transparency</h3>\r\n<p>Qwen 2.5-Max and its specialized siblings (Coder, Math) leapfrog many benchmarks, but rapid iteration also means new code, policies, and attack surfaces arrive every quarter. Staying safe requires tracking each release’s privacy terms, not just the marketing headlines.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Qwen AI Open-Source Security Risks (Qwen3 Apache Licence)</h3>\r\n<p>Open sourcing under Apache 2.0 widens adoption—and widens the responsibility for secure deployment. Developers gain freedom to fine-tune locally, yet they must now harden endpoints against prompt-injection and data-leak attacks themselves.</p>\r\n<p>Qwen AI GDPR Compliance 2025—Storage, Retention &amp; Cross-Border Transfers<br />• <strong>Account &amp; Identity</strong>: Name, email, and SNS-login tokens gathered at sign-up.<br />• <strong>User Content</strong>: Every prompt, file, and image routed through Qwen Chat is stored.<br />• <strong>Usage &amp; Log Data</strong>: Device IDs, IP addresses, timestamps—vital for audits but sensitive if breached.<br />• <strong>Retention Gaps</strong>: The privacy notice promises “appropriate technical measures” yet omits fixed deletion windows, unlike OpenAI’s 30-day API rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Is Qwen AI Safe? Security Vulnerabilities, Prompt Injection &amp; Surveillance Risks</h2>\r\n<h3>Default Opt-In Training &amp; User Prompt Privacy</h3>\r\n<p>By accepting the March 1 2025 Terms of Service, users “expressly authorize” Alibaba to use non-personal parts of prompts for model training. In practice, personal and non-personal data often intermingle, so assume everything you type may help train the next Qwen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Chinese National Security Law &amp; Government Access Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Operating under China’s Cybersecurity, Data Security, and PIPL laws, Alibaba can be compelled to provide data—even if your files sit on a Singapore node. That extraterritorial reach is the single biggest trust hurdle for many Western enterprises.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Protect AI Report: Qwen 2.5-Max Security Vulnerabilities</h3>\r\n<p>A Protect AI red-team test scored Qwen 2.5-Max at 35/100 risk, with 48 % success for prompt-injection and 40 % for jailbreaks. One GitHub issue even showed entire chat sessions accessible via a copied URL. These are fixable bugs, but they prove vigilance is essential.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Qwen AI vs ChatGPT, Claude &amp; Gemini: Privacy Comparison 2025</h2>\r\n<p>Below is a high-level snapshot of default training, opt-out controls, and retention across major LLM platforms:</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th><strong>Platform (2025)</strong></th>\r\n<th><strong>Default Use of User Content for Training</strong></th>\r\n<th><strong>In-Service Opt-Out?</strong></th>\r\n<th><strong>Stated Retention Window</strong></th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Qwen Chat</strong></td>\r\n<td>Yes (opt-in by Terms of Service)</td>\r\n<td>No (exit only)</td>\r\n<td>Not specified</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>OpenAI Enterprise / API</strong></td>\r\n<td>No (opt-out by default)</td>\r\n<td>Yes</td>\r\n<td>30 days (API)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Google Gemini Workspace</strong></td>\r\n<td>No (within domain only)</td>\r\n<td>N/A</td>\r\n<td>18 months (user-controlled)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Anthropic Claude Business</strong></td>\r\n<td>No</td>\r\n<td>N/A</td>\r\n<td>Limited, not publicly disclosed</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2>Enterprise Playbook: Qwen AI PIPL &amp; GDPR Compliance Checklist</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Map Your Data Classes</strong>: Identify PII, IP, and regulated content before any prompt touches the cloud.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Choose the Right Tier</strong>: Prefer Model Studio or on-prem Qwen3 in a VPC if you need “no-training” guarantees.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Negotiate a DPA</strong>: Ensure Alibaba signs data-processing agreements that mirror GDPR or HIPAA needs.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Leverage Confidential AI</strong>: Deploy within Trusted Execution Environments (Intel TDX) to keep data encrypted in use.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Implement Output Filters</strong>: Route completions through policy-based sanitizers to catch toxic or confidential leaks.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Audit &amp; Log</strong>: Enable Alibaba Security Center scanning for AI containers; keep immutable logs for at least six years where regulations demand.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Personal Data Protection: Practical Tips for Using Qwen AI Chat Safely</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Avoid pasting sensitive personal, health, or financial details.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Use burner prompts when experimenting.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Log out after each session; never share URLs from an active chat.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Track policy updates (Privacy Policy April 25 2025, ToS March 1 2025) quarterly.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Future Outlook: Qwen AI Data Protection Roadmap Beyond 2025</h2>\r\n<p>• <strong>Policy Shifts</strong>: Alibaba may add granular opt-outs to match Western rivals—check release notes.<br />• <strong>FLock Partnership</strong>: Decentralized training could reduce central data retention if pilot succeeds.<br />• <strong>Confidential Computing Rollouts</strong>: Expect TEEs-by-default for paid tiers, lowering legal friction.<br />• <strong>Regulatory Moves</strong>: EU AI Act enforcement and potential U.S. federal privacy law could pressure clearer retention rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)</h2>\r\n<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: Is Qwen AI safe to use for personal conversations in 2025?<br /><strong>ANSWER</strong>: Safety depends on what you share. Qwen Chat encrypts data in transit and at rest, but Alibaba uses prompts for training and remains subject to Chinese data-access laws. Treat Qwen Chat as a public forum for anything truly private.</p>\r\n<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: Does Qwen AI comply with GDPR?<br /><strong>ANSWER</strong>: Alibaba Cloud offers SCCs and BS 10012-aligned processes, yet Chinese national-security overrides mean enforcement of EU rights (like erasure) is uncertain. Enterprises should demand a strong DPA and consider TEEs for sensitive EU data.</p>\r\n<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: Where does Qwen AI store my data?<br /><strong>ANSWER</strong>: Storage defaults to Alibaba Cloud regions selected for your account (e.g., Singapore for South-Korean users). However, the company reserves the right to transfer data internationally within its corporate group.</p>\r\n<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: Can businesses stop Qwen from training on their data?<br /><strong>ANSWER</strong>: Yes, but only by choosing enterprise offerings such as Model Studio or on-prem deployments that explicitly state “no training without consent.” The public Qwen Chat app offers no granular opt-out.</p>\r\n<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: How does Qwen AI compare to DeepSeek on privacy?<br /><strong>ANSWER</strong>: Protect AI testing shows Qwen 2.5-Max more resilient to jailbreaks than DeepSeek-V3, but Qwen’s ToS still defaults to training on user content, whereas DeepSeek positions itself as privacy-first with stricter retention controls.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:<br />Qwen AI delivers impressive language performance, yet its default data-use stance and Chinese jurisdiction create unique privacy challenges. By choosing the right deployment tier, enforcing strong contractual safeguards, and applying confidential-computing layers, organizations can tap Qwen’s power while keeping regulators—and risk officers—on-side. Individuals, meanwhile, should think twice before sharing anything in Qwen Chat they wouldn’t post publicly.</p>";
