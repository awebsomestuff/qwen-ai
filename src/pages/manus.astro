It's powered in part by <strong>Alibaba's Qwen</strong>—a large language model fine-tuned to excel at tasks.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</section><section class=\"qwen-section\">\r\n<div class=\"qwen-section-header\">\r\n<h2>Origins and Development</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"qwen-section-divider\"></div>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Developer</strong>: Monica, a Chinese startup that previously created Monica.ai.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Leadership</strong>: Xiao Hong (CEO) and Yichao \"Peak\" Ji (chief scientist).</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Launch Date</strong>: March 6, 2025, in a private beta format.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Comparison to DeepSeek</strong>: While DeepSeek created its own massive foundation model, Manus AI uniquely integrates both <strong>Claude</strong> and <strong>Qwen</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</section><section class=\"qwen-feature-highlight\">\r\n<div class=\"feature-highlight-header\">\r\n<h2>Why \"Manus\"?</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"feature-highlight-body\">\r\n\r\nThe name comes from the Latin word for \"hand.\" The idea is that Manus AI acts as an extra helping hand, automating repetitive or complex digital tasks so humans can focus on bigger decisions.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</section>\r\n<div class=\"qwen-products-section\">\r\n<div class=\"qwen-product-card\">\r\n<div class=\"product-card-header\">\r\n<h2>Technical Foundations</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"product-card-body\">\r\n<h3>Qwen: Alibaba's Model Explained</h3>\r\nQwen is a family of large language models developed by Alibaba Cloud. Key points:\r\n<ul class=\"feature-list\">\r\n \t<li><strong>Sizes</strong>: From 1.8B to 72B parameters.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Notable Variants</strong>: Qwen2.5-Max (Mixture-of-Experts), QwQ-32B for high-level reasoning.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Use Cases</strong>: Excels at math, coding tasks, and creative output.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Open Source</strong>: Available under Apache 2.0 for enterprise customization.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"qwen-product-card\">\r\n<div class=\"product-card-header\">\r\n<h2>Fine-Tuning in Manus AI</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"product-card-body\">\r\n\r\nManus AI <strong>fine-tunes</strong> Qwen to handle tasks specific to automation and multi-step workflows. This involves:\r\n<ul class=\"feature-list\">\r\n \t<li><strong>Domain-Specific Data</strong>: Website creation, financial analysis, insurance comparisons, etc.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Training Techniques</strong>: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and possible low-precision optimizations (LoRA, quantization).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBy narrowing Qwen's focus, Manus AI can execute tasks (not just provide suggestions) with higher accuracy.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"qwen-product-card\">\r\n<div class=\"product-card-header\">\r\n<h2>Anthropic's Claude Integration</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"product-card-body\">\r\n\r\nManus AI also utilizes <strong>Anthropic's Claude</strong> (versions 3.5 Sonnet v1 and, in testing, Claude 3.7) for natural language reasoning. According to co-founder Ji:\r\n<blockquote>\"We built Manus using Claude 3.5 Sonnet v1 and different fine-tuned versions of Qwen. Initially, only Claude 3.5 Sonnet v1 was available, requiring numerous auxiliary models.\"</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<section class=\"qwen-section\">\r\n<div class=\"qwen-section-header\">\r\n<h2>How Does Manus AI Work?
